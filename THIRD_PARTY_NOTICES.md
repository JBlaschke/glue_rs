# Third-party notices: linked Lua profile

These notices cover the Lua source and bindings used by the initial linked
execution profile, plus the Lua source builder. This is a component notice
record; it does not replace a complete release dependency inventory.

The pinned source is `lua-src 551.0.2` (crate SHA-256
`d400ffef0e3d4d29287092bdc5a276d0bf468b2c69709d5bab0d469312d9f947`),
whose selected source is Lua 5.4.9 or Lua 5.5.1, depending on the explicit
linked build profile.

## Lua 5.4.9

The following notice comes from `lua-src-551.0.2/lua-5.4.9/lua.h`.
It preserves the current source copyright separately from the older Lua notice
also included in the source-builder package's license below.
